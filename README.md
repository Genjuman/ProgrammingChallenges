# ProgrammingChallenges
Here I will add some programming challenges, also with original problem tasks and maybe with some my comment.

These programming challenges are from book **Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual** *by Steven S Skiena (Author), Miguel A. Revilla*

Here is some URL: http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387001630

I've allready developed some of this challenges before, so I'll continue here, from where I finished before.

Every challenge's comming with source code and also my testing cases. I will be happy, if you send me comment about improving my coding skills :)

If you have any question or some job opportunity for me, just write me an email: Libor.o.Svoboda(at)gmail.com
